        <p>My name is Eileen Graves, and this is my 23rd year teaching fifth grade.  I am ESL certified and taught English as a Second Language classes for 3 years.  You might say that teaching is in my blood.  My father, stepmother, grandmother, aunt, and uncle were all teachers.  Here's a fun fact:  My paternal grandmother had my maternal grandmother in her sixth-grade class!  I have the report card to prove it.
My philosophy about education is this:  student + parent + teacher = success.  We all need to work together to ensure that our fifth-graders learn everything they need to know before middle school. 
My dream is to help my kids reach their own dreams.</p>
